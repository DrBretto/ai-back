        Now, please read the following text and identify the sentiments from the master list:
        
       Gold prices (XAUUSD) reached a new all-time high early Monday, with a significant rally fueled by the anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This rally brought the price of gold to $2,445 per ounce, surpassing the previous record high of $2,430 set on April 12. The increase in gold prices, around 20% since the beginning of the year, has been propelled by dwindling inflation figures, which have shifted investment tactics. Lower inflation reduces the yield on cash deposits, prompting investors to move away from the US dollar and seek potential gains in alternative assets like gold, thus increasing its appeal. Silver also rose, reaching an 11-year high of $32, although it remains below its 2011 peak of $49.78.
